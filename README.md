This is a Student Management System written in C, showcasing key features of the C programming language such as dynamic memory allocation and modular programming. This program is designed to help manage student records by adding, displaying, searching, sorting, and updating student information.

# Features:

- Dynamic Memory Management: Uses malloc for initial memory allocation and realloc to expand the array of students as needed.
Memory is explicitly freed using free to prevent leaks.

- Modular and reusable code structure, making it easy to extend and maintain.

- Bubble Sort: Demonstrates sorting using a basic bubble sort algorithm tailored to student grades.
Modular Design

- Encapsulates functionalities into separate functions (addStudent, displayStudents, etc.) for clarity and reusability.
